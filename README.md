# Digital-Clock
A simple desktop digital clock application developed using Python’s Tkinter library.


🚀**Project Overview:**

This is a digital clock application built with Python and Tkinter that displays the current time in 12-hour format along with the full date. The interface is clean and visually appealing with live updates every second. It continuously refreshes to show real-time changes, making it fully functional as a real-time clock. This project demonstrates the use of Tkinter for creating interactive and dynamic GUI applications.

✨**Key Features:**

✔ Real-Time Digital Clock:

The application displays the current time and updates automatically every second, so the clock always stays accurate.

✔ 12-Hour Time Format with AM/PM:

The time is shown in a 12-hour format including AM or PM, which is user friendly and easy to read.

✔ Full Date Display:

Along with time, the app shows the full date including day name, day number, month name, and year.

✔ Minimal and Clean User Interface:

The UI uses a dark background with bright text colors, creating good contrast and clear visibility.

✔ Automatic Refresh Without Freezing:

The clock updates smoothly using Tkinter’s built-in scheduling method instead of loops or delays.



🛠️**Technical Architecture:**

1.Programming Language and Library

✔ Language: Python

✔ GUI Library: Tkinter

✔ Time Handling: time.strftime

2.Event-Driven Design

The application follows an event-driven model where the GUI remains responsive while updates are scheduled in the background.

3.UI Components

✔ Label widgets are used to display time and date

✔ Fonts and colors are customized for readability and visual appeal

4.Update Mechanism

The update_display() function:

✔ Fetches the current system time and date using strftime

✔ Updates the label text

✔ Uses root.after(1000, update_display) to schedule the next update after one second

5.Efficient Scheduling

Tkinter’s after() method ensures the program does not block the main thread, avoiding performance issues or UI freezing.

6.Simple and Maintainable Structure

The code is modular and easy to understand, making it simple to extend with features like alarms, themes, or time format switching.
